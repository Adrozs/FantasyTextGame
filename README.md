# FantasyConsoleGame

A little side project I started to work on to incorporate the knowledge I've gained so far since I started studying Fullstack.NET development in september.
Mainly to practice with classes and just having fun with code.

[At the moment it's currently just working demo basically, many feature's not implemented. If you try to break it, it'll break...]

You take on the role as one of 3 adventurers. A Knight, A Sorcerer or the mysterious Shadow... To venture around in a fantasy world fighting various creatures and exploring the mysterious and magical world of name I haven't come up with yet.

!--IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT SOUND EFFECTS TO WORK--!

Download the Sound folder and add it to the repository folder. Example for me it is "C:\User\User\repos\FantasyConsoleGame\Sounds"

---------------------------------------
On my to-do list is the following:

-Make so that choosing character works and has meaning

-Implement XP when killing monsters so that you level up and increase in HP and DMG.

-Implement health potions

-Create an item and loot system, so that monster can drop better weapons and health potions along with coins.

-Make it so that every 5 encounters there's a rest event where you have a 70% chance to make camp where you can rest to gain hp but have a small chance to get attacked in the night. And 30% chance to stumble upon a small town/village/tavern where you can rest, heal up and shop weapon upgrades and health potions without risk of being attacked.

-Add more monsters, like variations of the same as now but with different names for variety and some more like bandits among others.

-Add more locations to visit and perhaps make it so it's more advanced then just descriptive text? Don't know what though yet.
